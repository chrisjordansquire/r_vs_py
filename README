This contains a comparison of R and Python for a simple OLS analyis 
of a dateset. 

The original comparison is in the folder original. 

A revised comparison, using comments from the scipy users list,
is in the folder revised. 

This revised comparison has simpler R and Python code and uses pandas
for part of the analysis. (However, it is pandas 0.4, which is 
currently in development.)
